# MiniProject_ISL
## Real Time ISL prediction

## We have done this project in our 5th semester (Aug 2020- December 2020)


# METHODOLOGY

# 1. Dataset Generation:
  
As less research has been done for the Indian Sign Language as compared to ASL proper dataset
is not available for ISL, so we have prepared our own dataset. We have built a python file
through which we can generate our data for all the Classes. So for creating a dataset we have to
use the Open Computer Vision(OpenCV) library. Firstly we captured around 7000 total images
200 for each 35 labels ISL. Then we divided the dataset in 80:20 percent ratio into training and
testing data respectively.
